        <div>My name is Elliot Edison (yes, I am related to the inventor of the light bulb, but let's not get off topic here)</div>
        <div>I don't mean to brag, but I am one of the most brilliant alchemists in the kingdom</div>
        <div>I'm mostly known for developing a formula that cures several forms of cancer previously thought to be untreatable</div>
        <div>So brilliant, that a notorious vampire clan kidnapped me so they could turn me into one of them.  </div>
        <div>They want me to develop formulas that will lure in prey and, with my fame, improve the reputation of the clan</div>
        <div>Many people have tried to get me to turn them into a vampire, offering me a lifetime of servitude</div>
        <div> A lot of people want to be a vampire. We're rich and good-looking. 
            We have superhuman strength, can transform into bats to fly, drain blood, sometimes control the minds of people, and best of all,  are immortal. </div>
        <div>They are fools! Vampirism is a curse!  You're dead, but alive at the same time, finding neither the joy of life nor the peace of the afterlife.  It feels terrible, like you're always on the verge of dying. You're an abomination, a mere mockery of life.</div>
        <div>You can't even go out into the sun without dying. I used to be an avid outdoorsman, with very tan skin from soaking up all that sun. My favorite food used to be garlic bread. </div>
        <div>The people who used to be your friends and family are just food to you now.  You grow addicted to blood.  It becomes all you think about.</div>
        <div>Nobody really cares about you. Vampires betray each other left and right, even when in the same clan. </div>
        <div>I am cursed.  So I am going to do the same thing everyone with a curse does.  I will try to break my curse, and become human again.</div>
        <div>I know it seems impossible, and probably is.  But I will do anything to be alive again</div>
        <div>Many a fellow vampire asked me why I want to go back to being a weak, pathetic human.  The reason why, is to see the sun.</div>
        <div>The first step to ending my curse is to go to my lab.</div>
